Feature: add pre-survey results

  As an ambassador
  So that I can generate pre-survey reports
  I want to have the data in an easy to access location

Background: results are to be added to database

  Given the following users exist:
    | email              | password | name         | type | school_semester_id |
    | amirk88@gmail.com  | 123f5    | amir khodaei | 1    |     1     |

  Given the following schools exist:
    | name | county | city | 
    | "school1" | "Alameda" | "Berkeley" |
    
  Given the following school_semesters exist:
    | school_id |   name   | year |
    |     1     |   Fall   | 2011 |
